To access Object Storage buckets and objects, youâ€™ll first need to configure your credentials and initialize the S3 client session.

Generate an access key and secret key for Object Storage through the Cloud Manager by following the Managing Access Keys guide. (https://www.linode.com/docs/products/storage/object-storage/guides/access-keys/)

Add the following code to your python script, replacing [access-key] and [secret-key] with the values generated in the previous step. Also replace [cluster-url] with the cluster URL corresponding to the data center your buckets are located within (listed on the Access Buckets and Files through URLs page). (https://www.linode.com/docs/products/storage/object-storage/guides/urls/)
